        <h1>How we collect your data</h1>
        <p>GD Skillsetguessr does not collect, store, or share any personal data from visitors. It also does not use cookies.
        All data is stored entirely on the user's device using localStorage for the sole purpose of saving every round the user has played. This data can be cleared at any time via either your browser settings, or the "CLEAR ALL DATA" button located in the "My best scores" menu, accessible through the main menu as long as you have local storage, and is never sent to any external server.</p>

        <h1>Third-Party Services</h1>
        <p>
        However, it incorporates embedded autoplaying YouTube videos, which load as soon as you choose a dataset on the main menu. These are supplied by Google LLC, which may collect information such as IP addresses, device details, and more personal information about you.
        For more details on how Google treats your data, please read the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <p>
        The website also utilizes the API of the <a href="https://gdladder.com/">Geometry Dash Demon Ladder</a> and the <a href="https://aredl.net/">All Rated Extreme Demons List</a>, neither of which store any of your personal data, nor does GD Skillsetguessr ever send them any personal data.
        </p>
        <p>However, to fetch this data, it is processed through Cloudflare, which is only ever used as a means to fetch data from the previously mentioned APIs. Cloudflare may temporarily access your IP address and other information it needs to fetch the data securely.</p>
        <p>For more information on how Cloudflare treats your data, please read the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/">Cloudflare Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
